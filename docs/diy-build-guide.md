This guide will help you build your own basic version of the LayerLapse timelapse trigger using off-the-shelf parts.

## üîå What You Need

| Item | Example/Link |
|------|----------------|
| Microntroller (like an Arduino or anything else that you have) | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4ibiYyZ) |
| Hall effect sensor (3-pin, e.g., A3144) | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4ja3YCi) |
| Camera trigger (compatible with your camera) | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4hSzcg3) |
| Transistor (e.g., PN2222) | [What I used](https://amzn.to/3Y7ognG) |
| 1k Ohm resistor | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4hTAXtA) |
| Breadboard jumper wires | [What I used](https://amzn.to/3RqsenG) |
| Magnets | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4j6uLz9) |

You'll also need an AC Power dummy battery (get one compatible with your camera). You'll need this for long printing sessions, so your camera doesn't die mid print.
This is [what I used](https://amzn.to/3XERjiq) for my Nikon camera.

### Optional:
| Item | Example/Link |
|------|----------------|
| Breadboard (optional) | [What I used](https://amzn.to/4292l0u) |
| 10k Ohm Potentiometer | [What I would use](https://amzn.to/4j2ZoFK) |
| 3M Double Sided Tape | [What I would use](https://amzn.to/4iLMnk6) |

# Steps

### Initial Setup
  
1. Take apart the camera trigger using a small screwdriver. The goal is to get the circuit boards by themselves. We just want the 2.5mm jack PCB from this trigger.

2. We can set aside the button circuit board. We will only be using the 2.5mm female jack for this project. You can cut the wires between them or unsolder the wires.
3. Now we have all the parts we need for this project.

### Wiring
  
  
***Note: All the pin numbers are arbitrary, but if you just want to copy and paste the code later, use the same pins.***
  
1. Connect the positive pin of the Hall sensor to the 5V pin on your Arduino
2. Connect the GND pin of the Hall sensor to the GND on the Arduino
3. Connect the OUT pin of the Hall sensor to pin 7
4. Connect the GND pin from the camera remote PCB and the AF pin to the ***emitter*** of the transistor
5. Connect a 1k Ohm resistor to the a jumper wire, and connect this to pin 5
6. Connect the RLS pin and the GND from the Arduino to the ***collector*** pin

Your device should look like the wiring below:

### üìÇ Code

You are now ready to upload the code to your Arduino.

## Mounting Sensor & Magnet

Everyone has different printers so this step will look different for everyone, but the main idea is the same for everyone.

### Steps

1. Affix a magnet to your printer head, somewhere where the sensor will be able to get close to it. ***On my Bambu Lab P1P, I placed the magnet on the bottom of the print head near the back right corner.***
2. Attach the sensor to the printer, somewhere it will be safe during printing. It needs to be right next to the magnet at its parked location. ***On my P1P, I taped the sensor to the frame on the right side near the back***

## Custom gcode

This is the very last step of the whole build. You'll need to figure out a location to park your printer. For example, I parked my P1P in the back right corner, and then I taped the hall sensor to the frame right under where the magnet will be. Save this location and add this to the layer change gcode in your slicer.

[See gcode examples here.](/code/custom-gcode)

## Final Remarks

Now all thats left is to plug in your arduino, plug in your camera to the 2.5mm jack, and get to printing!

### Tips:

- 

## üß† How It Works
- A magnet is affixed to the print head
- Printer's "layer change" gcode is modified to park the printer somewhere you specify, such as the back right corner of the printer
- When the printer parks in its designated location, the hall sensor detects the magnet on the parked printhead
- The Arduino waits for vibrations to settle (add a delay)
- The camera shutter is triggered using the transistor
- The printer then continues printing, repeating this process every layer
