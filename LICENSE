NOTE:

This license applies only to files in the `firmware/` directory.
You are welcome to build your own DIY version using off-the-shelf components (such as an Arduino and Hall sensor) with this firmware. A DIY section is included in this repository to help guide you through that.
However, the official LayerLapse hardware — including its custom PCB, physical design, and branding — remains proprietary and is not licensed for redistribution or reproduction.
Use of the hardware for commercial purposes is not permitted without explicit permission from Whopper Printing.
